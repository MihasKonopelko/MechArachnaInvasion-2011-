# MechArachnaInvasion-2011-
This is one of the first projects I ever coded back in 2011 using C# Forms and Visual Studio 11. The project was lighlty retouched in 2022.

Project Features:

  •	Simple gravity
  
  •	Jumps at a direction relative to mouse position
  
  •	Stamina bar and ammo bar. health displayed in the same way
  
  •	Medipacks and ammo
  
  •	Player can shoot 360 degrees
  
  •	Uses classes, sub-classes and arrays for simplicity
  
  •	Self-drawn sprites
  
  •	Self-build level by in-program created level builder (saved about 6-7 hours of my time)
  
  •	Automated collision detection
  
  •	Items spawn after 1 minute
  
  •	(dedicate to minecraft) rectangular clouds
  
  •	Restart button
  
---------------------- 
Controls:

•	A & D to move left and right

•	Space to jump

•	Left Mouse Button to turn on and turn off the laser beam

•	R to restart the game

----------------------

Bugs:

•	Screen flickers (for some computers)
  
•	Couldn't make proper collision detection for walls when player jumps on top of it or hits it underground, so i will use them in combination with floors (minor)
 
----------------------

Description: this is a side-view platformer where player shall stand against infinite amount of robothic spiders with low ammo and try to get the high score

----------------------

Important Note: while I inteded to keep this project unaltered, I have one change:
-I have modified the path names to images and used Environment.CurrentDirectory to get correct paths to the images.
