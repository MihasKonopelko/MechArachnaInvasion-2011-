# MechArachnaInvasion-2011-
This is one of the first projects I ever coded back in 2011 using C# Forms and Visual Studio 11. The project was lighlty retouched in 2022.

Project Features:
  •	SIMPLE GRAVITY
  •	JUMPS AT A DIRECTION RELATIVE TO MOUSE POSITION
  •	STAMINA BAR AND AMMO BAR. HEALTH DISPLAYED IN THE SAME WAY
  •	MEDIPACKS AND AMMO
  •	PLAYER CAN SHOOT 360 DEGREES
  •	USES CLASSES, SUB-CLASSES AND ARRAYS FOR SIMPLICITY
  •	SELF-DRAWN SPRITES
  •	SELF-BUILD LEVEL BY IN-PROGRAM CREATED LEVEL BUILDER (SAVED ABOUT 6-7 HOURS OF MY TIME)
  •	AUTOMATED COLLISION DETECTION
  •	ITEMS SPAWN AFTER 1 MINUTE
  •	(DEDICATE TO MINECRAFT) RECTANGULAR CLOUDS
  •	RESTART BUTTON
  ----------------------
  BUGS:
    - SCREEN FLICKERS (for some computers)
    - COULDN'T MAKE PROPER COLLISION DETECTION FOR WALLS WHEN PLAYER JUMPS ON TOP OF IT OR HITS IT UNDERGROUND, SO I WILL USE THEM IN COMBINATION WITH FLOORS (MINOR)
  ----------------------
  DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A SIDE-VIEW PLATFORMER WHERE PLAYER SHALL STAND AGAINST INFINITE AMOUNT OF ROBOTHIC SPIDERS WITH LOW AMMO AND TRY TO GET THE HIGH SCORE

Important Note: While I inteded to keep this project unaltered, I have one change:
-I have modified the path names to images and used Environment.CurrentDirectory to get correct paths to the images.
